===============================================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Sparse Distributed Memory Framework.


Parts of the documentation
--------------------------

The documentation is organized in two parts: C API and Python Library.

It is suggested to use the Python Library. It is a facade which simplifies the creation and manipulation of SDM instances. It also works in the Jupyter Notebook.

The C API is the low level module which may be extended to add new operations to the SDM.

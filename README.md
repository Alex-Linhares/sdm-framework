Sparse Distributed Memory Framework
===================================
This project intends to be a framework which can be adapted to any usage of a Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva, 1988).

We would really like to ask users for feedback, and, should they find it useful, a link or citation:

Brogliato, M.S.; Linhares, A. (2016) Sparse Distributed Memory: a reference implementation.  Working Paper, FGV, Vialink. 

Please notice that it is still in development and not ready to be used. :)


How do I contribute?
====================
Just fork it and do the usual pull request dance. :)

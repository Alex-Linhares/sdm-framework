Sparse Distributed Memory Framework
===================================
This project intends to be a framework which can be adapted to any usage of a Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva, 1988).

It is still in development and not ready to be used. :)

== How do I contribute?

Just fork it and do the usual pull request dance. :)
